The game is as follows: walls randomly appear on the screen and the player needs to break them all. As often the cursor moves or shoots as often new walls appear. The goal of the game is not to leave any walls.
The player can move up or down the shooter cursor using corresponding keys. Press `d` to shoot.
To build the game use the following command:
```
g++ main.cpp -lncurses -o wall_shooter
```
To run the game type
```
./wall_shooter
```
